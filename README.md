# OpenDance Engine
OpenDance is a attempt of recreating Ubisoft's **Just Dance Now** engine through **GameMaker Language**

Called "Bluestar Engine", it is made in JavaScript and CSS, being only used on **Just Dance Now**

Every piece of code is being written by hand, or ported from Bluestar, or taken from open-source projects

- Please, note that this is being done alone by a amateur developer, so, as expected, this is gonna take a long time before it becomes anything playable
- Also, i'm not sure about **when** i'll publish the source code, so stay tuned

## Features
### Working features:
- Reads JSONs from all versions of **Just Dance Now**, including **Just Dance: Vitality School**
- Video playback (through [libWEBMPlayer](https://github.com/time-killer-games/libWebMPlayer))

### To-do stuff:
- Full pictogram system (including Solo, Duo, Trio, Quartet and Sextet)
- Scrolling lyrics system
- Compatibility with **Just Dance Unlimited** files without converting them to JSONs
- Compatibility with Chinese, Japanese, Korean and other languages with non-Latin characters
- UI (yeah, the entire thing)
