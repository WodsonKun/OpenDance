## Description
OpenDance aims to recreate Ubisoft's Just Dance gameplay from both **UbiArt Framework** and **Bluestar Engine**, by using **GameMaker Language**.

Every piece of code is being written by hand or reverse-engineered from said engines

Note that this is being developed by a single person, and updates can take some time to be done

## Glossary
UbiArt Framework (or UAF) was a game engine made by Ubisoft and used in several games as Rayman Origins, Rayman Legends, Child of Light and several Just Dance games (from Just Dance 2014 to Just Dance 2022)

Bluestar Engine is a game engine also made by Ubisoft exclusively for web browsers, it is only used on Just Dance Now.

## Features
### Working features:
- Works with files from both Bluestar Engine (JSON) and UbiArt Framework (CKD), retaining the same file structure from UbiArt for easier use.
- Video and audio playback
- KaraokeClip, PictogramClip and GoldMoveEffectClip

### To-do stuff:
- Include **Just Dance: Vitality School** (BeatsPreview JSON) support
- Compatibility with non-Latin characters
- MoveSpace scoring system (using MSM files and Controller / DSU)
- Camera scoring system (using GESTURE files and Kinect)
- Include MainSequence (UbiArt) suport
- Improve timing system
