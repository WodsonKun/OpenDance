# OpenDance Engine
OpenDance is a attempt of recreating Ubisoft's **Just Dance Now** engine through **GameMaker Language**

## Description
Called "Bluestar Engine", it is made in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, being only used on **Just Dance Now**

Every piece of code is being written by hand, or ported from Bluestar, or taken from open-source projects

- Please, note that this is being done alone by a amateur developer, so, as expected, this is gonna take a long time before it becomes anything playable

## Features
### Working features:
- Reads JSONs from all versions of **Just Dance Now**, including **Just Dance: Vitality School**
- Displays lyrics and pictograms (80%), still W.I.P.
- Video playback (through [libWEBMPlayer](https://github.com/time-killer-games/libWebMPlayer))

### To-do stuff:
- Compatibility with **Just Dance Unlimited** files without converting them to JSONs
- Compatibility with Chinese, Japanese, Korean and other languages with non-Latin characters
- UI (yeah, the entire thing)
