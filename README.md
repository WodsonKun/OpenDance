# OpenDance Engine
OpenDance is a attempt of recreating Ubisoft's **Just Dance Now** engine through **GameMaker Language**

Called "Bluestar Engine", it is made in JavaScript and CSS, being only used on **Just Dance Now**

Every piece of code is being written by hand, or ported from Bluestar

- Please, note that this is being done alone by a amateur developer, so, as expected, this is gonna take a long time before it becomes anything playable
- Also, i'm not sure about **when** i'll publish the source code, so stay tuned

## Features
### Working features:
- Reads JSONs from both versions of **Just Dance Now**
- Video playback for routines
- Shows pictograms
- W.I.P. in-game UI

### Missing features:
- Scrolling lyrics
- UI
